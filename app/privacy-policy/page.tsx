              At Integrated Health Care Services Psychiatry, we are committed to protecting your privacy—both in person and online. This section outlines how we handle your protected health information (PHI) during the use of our TeleMedicine services.
            </p>

            <h3>1. TeleMedicine Services</h3>
            <p>
              We provide psychiatric and mental health services through TeleMedicine, including consultations, evaluations, follow-ups, and medication management. These services are delivered using secure, HIPAA-compliant video and audio platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use of Third-Party Platforms</h3>
            <p>
              We may use HIPAA-compliant third-party platforms such as Zoom for Healthcare, Doxy.me, SimplePractice, or others to conduct virtual visits. These platforms are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your health information. We do not permit them to use your data for any marketing, profiling, or non-clinical purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Collection & Use of Information</h3>
            <p>During TeleMedicine appointments, we may collect information such as:</p>

              <li>Name, date of birth, and contact details</li>
              <li>Medical history, symptoms, prescriptions, and other health data</li>
              <li>Audio/video content of the session if required for documentation (with your consent)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This information is used solely to provide medical care, maintain accurate records, and comply with state/federal regulations.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Your Consent</h3>
            <p>By scheduling or attending a TeleMedicine session, you consent to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The electronic communication of your health information</li>
              <li>The use of HIPAA-compliant video/audio platforms</li>
              <li>Receiving medical treatment remotely from our licensed providers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you prefer in-person care, you may opt out of TeleMedicine at any time (where available).
            </p>

            <h3>5. Location Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              We are only permitted to treat patients physically located in the state(s) where our providers are licensed to practice. By using our TeleMedicine services, you confirm that you are in Florida.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>
              We take your privacy seriously. All electronic transmissions are encrypted and protected by strong administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Only authorized personnel have access to your information, and we do not share your data without your explicit written consent unless required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Limitations of TeleMedicine</h3>
            <p>
              While TeleMedicine is highly effective, certain situations may require in-person evaluation or emergency care. In the event of a crisis or urgent need, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.
